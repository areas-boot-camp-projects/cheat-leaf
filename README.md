# Cheat Leaf
## Description
A clean, well-designed cheat-sheet, web platform that hosts data related to code blocks and other information. It’s an all-around good resource for finding unique data sets to help you get ahead.

Users create “cheat leafs” they can share with others. They can organize their “cheat leafs” in “branches”. And they themselves are considered “trees.” All together, users come together into a community known as a “forest of ideas.” It’s the kind of place that grows on you.
